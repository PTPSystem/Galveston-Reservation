# Galveston Reservation

Unified tooling to manage a short‚Äëterm rental property in Galveston by: (1) displaying Google Calendar availability, (2) orchestrating the end‚Äëto‚Äëend operational workflow (booking ‚Üí prep ‚Üí guest stay ‚Üí turnover), and (3) automatically cross‚Äëchecking an external/online calendar source to ensure no bookings are missed on Google Calendar.

> Status: Initial README scaffold (no committed implementation code yet). This document defines the intended architecture & workflows so code can be added consistently.

## ‚ú® Core Functions

1. Show calendar from Google Account
   - Read reservations / events from a designated Google Calendar (e.g. `Primary` or a dedicated rental calendar) and present them in a human‚Äëfriendly view (CLI, web, or dashboard).
2. Short‚Äëterm rental workflow automation
   - Standardize tasks triggered by each booking lifecycle stage (booking confirmation, pre‚Äëarrival messaging, check‚Äëin, mid‚Äëstay, checkout, cleaning/turnover, maintenance follow‚Äëups).
3. External calendar consistency check
   - Poll or fetch an online calendar (e.g. listing platform iCal feed / partner portal / scraped availability page) and reconcile it against Google Calendar to detect missing or divergent events.

## üß≠ Intended Architecture (Proposed)

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| Data Sources | Google Calendar API, External iCal / HTML feed, Local cache (SQLite / JSON) |
| Ingestion | Scheduled fetchers (cron / GitHub Actions / local script) |
| Core Logic | Booking normalization, diff engine, workflow state machine |
| Notifications | Email (SMTP), SMS (Twilio), or Chat (Slack / Teams) adapters |
| Presentation | CLI reports, optional lightweight web dashboard |

> Adjust once actual language / frameworks are chosen.

## üîê Prerequisites

Because implementation details are not yet committed, below are assumed prerequisites:

- A Google Cloud project with Calendar API enabled.
- OAuth 2.0 credentials (Service Account or OAuth Client) granting read/write access to the rental calendar.
- Access to the external calendar feed (public iCal URL, API key, or page URL for scraping).
- Runtime environment (pick one when coding begins):
   - Python 3.11+ (suggested) OR
   - Node.js 20+ OR
   - Another stack (document here once decided).

## üóÇ Data Model (Conceptual)

Minimal normalized booking/event structure:

```json
{
  "id": "ext-1234" ,           // Stable unique identifier
  "source": "google|external",
  "start": "2025-08-14T15:00:00Z",
  "end": "2025-08-18T17:00:00Z",
  "guestName": "Jane Doe",
  "status": "confirmed|tentative|canceled",
  "notes": "Any freeform text",
  "raw": { /* Original provider payload */ }
}
```

## üîÑ Workflow Lifecycle (Draft)

| Stage | Trigger | Actions |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Booking Created | New event detected | Normalize + store; send confirmation template; schedule pre‚Äëarrival tasks |
| Pre‚ÄëArrival (T-3 days) | Time threshold | Send reminder, lock code provisioning, cleaning confirmation |
| Check‚ÄëIn Day | Start date morning | Send welcome message & instructions |
| Mid‚ÄëStay (optional) | Midpoint | Courtesy message, upsell opportunities |
| Checkout Day | End date morning | Send checkout procedures & review request scheduling |
| Post‚ÄëCheckout | After end | Create cleaning task; maintenance flagging; send review request |
| Discrepancy Detected | Diff engine finds missing event | Alert via configured channel |

## ‚úÖ External Calendar Reconciliation

1. Fetch Google events for target window (e.g. next 180 days).
2. Fetch external calendar feed.
3. Normalize both ‚Üí unified structure.
4. Compare on (date range overlap + guest name + length). Heuristics for fuzzy matching (e.g. ¬±1 hour tolerance).
5. Produce a diff report:
   - Missing in Google
   - Missing in External
   - Attribute mismatches (dates shifted, status different)
6. Persist last diff snapshot (for change tracking) and emit notifications only on new discrepancies (avoid spam).

## üõ† Setup (Proposed Steps ‚Äì adapt once stack chosen)

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Galveston-Reservation
```

### 2. Environment Variables (example `.env`)

```bash
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./secrets/service-account.json
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
EXTERNAL_CALENDAR_URL=https://example.com/calendar.ics
NOTIFY_EMAIL=alerts@example.com
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ
```
(Only include what you implement; rotate secrets appropriately.)

### 3. Credentials
 
- Create a Service Account (if server-side) with Calendar API scope (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` or read-only variant).
- Download JSON key ‚Üí place in `./secrets/` (never commit) ‚Üí reference with `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`.
- If using OAuth user consent for write operations, implement token storage (e.g. `token.json`).

### 4. (If Python Stack Example)
 
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (to be created)
```

### 5. First Run (Hypothetical CLI)
 
 
```bash
python scripts/fetch_google_calendar.py --days 60
python scripts/check_discrepancies.py --window 180 --format table
python scripts/run_workflow_tick.py  # processes due workflow actions
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy (Planned)

| Test Type | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Unit | Normalization logic, date range comparisons, workflow transitions |
| Integration | Google API fetch, external feed parse, notification send |
| Regression | Diff engine stability across edge cases (overlapping bookings, daylight savings) |

## üö® Edge Cases To Handle

- Overlapping bookings (platform double-book vs. split stays)
- Daylight Saving Time transitions
- Canceled or modified events (ID reuse vs new event ID)
- Partial stays (guest leaves early)
- External feed latency (stale data windows)

## üì§ Notifications (Options)

- Email (SMTP / SendGrid)
- Slack incoming webhook
- SMS (Twilio)
- Console / log only (dev mode)

## üìà Future Enhancements

- Web UI dashboard (availability grid + discrepancy badges)
- Auto-repair (create missing Google events automatically after confirmation)
- Metrics export (Prometheus / simple CSV)
- Guest communication templates with localization
- Multi-property support (property_id dimension)

## üßæ Project Conventions (To Decide)

| Area | Suggested Choice |
|------|------------------|
| Language | Python 3.11 (timezone handling: `pytz` / `zoneinfo`) |
| Packaging | `pyproject.toml` + `poetry` or `pip-tools` |
| Scheduler | Cron (system) or lightweight APScheduler task loop |
| Persistence | SQLite via SQLAlchemy OR plain JSON for MVP |
| Logging | Structured (JSON) using `structlog` |
| Lint/Format | `ruff`, `black`, `mypy` |

(Revise when implementation starts.)

## üîí Security Notes

- Never commit raw credential files.
- Principle of least privilege for Service Account.
- Rate limit external polling to respect provider terms.
- Store secrets in environment or a secret manager (GCP Secret Manager) for production.

## ü§ù Contributions

Until core code is present, contributions should focus on:

- Defining concrete data schema
- Selecting baseline tech stack
- Drafting minimal ingestion scripts

Open an issue describing the proposal before large changes.

## üì£ Getting Help

Create a GitHub Issue with:

- Description of problem
- Steps to reproduce (if runtime issue)
- Logs (with secrets redacted)

## üóì Changelog
