We had to strip a bead and wash a set of sheets and clean a toilet to get thru the night.   The emergency number was called and we left a message.  The next morning they showed up to clean.  The Rental office didn&#x2019;t even offer to comp the first night which was very disappointing.  Otherwise the home was beautiful.  We fished off the doc and actually caught crab and catfish.  It was a great location for a group get together.  "}

It was very clean & had everything we could need. The communication with the rental company was great. They were very helpful & accommodating. We brought our jet ski down & was able to store it at the dock, which was great. It has an amazing view! Beautiful sunsets! It was amazing to sit out on the deck & watch the water & relax."}

We have rented many houses in the past mostly beach side houses but this bay front house is much better than beach houses because you can do more at bay front ones. I would definitely go back to this house."}

  "reviewBody": "This property is very nice. The accommodations were perfect for our group of 9 people and we loved the location. We truly enjoyed our stay.<br\/><br\/>There are a few things that should have been addressed or clarified in the property description. The major one is the boat lift is not available to use. It would have been nice to know that we only had access to the slips as we planned on using the lift. This is NOT a no wake zone so other boaters can cause a lot of wake and our boat took a beating just being tied, even with bumpers, and not lifted. The outdoor swings were rusted out and broken. One of the kids (7yo) fell through one of them the first time he sat down the very first evening. The outdoor grill was left dirty too.<br\/><br\/>The amenities i.e., liquid hand soap and dish soap were watered down. The sponges were gross. The dishwasher soap wasn't good either and there was no laundry soap. There were no dish towels or oven mitts either. For these things, had we known, we would have brought our own but instead, spent a small fortune at the local store purchasing these items. We were only told to bring paper towels, toilet paper and trash bags so we assumed everything else would be provided.<br\/><br\/>A couple ceiling fans didn't work and there were also a few burned out light bulbs. (no biggie)<br\/><br\/>There was a foul smell in the first floor bathroom so we kept the door open the entire time. <br\/><br\/>All in all, we would stay here again for future family get togethers and know we know what we need to bring.<br\/><br\/>P.S. A blender would have been great."}  ],

The accommodations were perfect for our group of 9 people and we loved the location. We truly enjoyed our stay.<br /><br />There are a few things that should have been addressed or clarified in the property description. The major one is the boat lift is not available to use. It would have been nice to know that we only had access to the slips as we planned on using the lift. This is NOT a no wake zone so other boaters can cause a lot of wake and our boat took a beating just being tied, even with bumpers, and not lifted. The outdoor swings were rusted out and broken. One of the kids (7yo) fell through one of them the first time he sat down the very first evening. The outdoor grill was left dirty too.<br /><br />The amenities i.e., liquid hand soap and dish soap were watered down. The sponges were gross. The dishwasher soap wasn't good either and there was no laundry soap. There were no dish towels or oven mitts either. For these things, had we known, we would have brought our own but instead, spent a small fortune at the local store purchasing these items. We were only told to bring paper towels, toilet paper and trash bags so we assumed everything else would be provided.<br /><br />A couple ceiling fans didn't work and there were also a few burned out light bulbs. (no biggie)<br /><br />There was a foul smell in the first floor bathroom so we kept the door open the entire time. <br /><br />All in all, we would stay here again for future family get togethers and know we know what we need to bring.<br /><br />P.S. A blender would have been great.</p></div></div><div class="rc-core-item-review"><h4 itemprop='name'>Great views great home</h4><div class="reviewed-by"><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="March 2025">March 2025 <br /> <span itemprop="author">Tabatha W.</span>, La veta, CO US</div><br/><div class="rc-core-review-scores"> <div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-">Overall<div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div><div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-5">Services from rental manager<meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5"><div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div><div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-5">Cleanliness<meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5"><div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div><div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-5">Location<meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5"><div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div><div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-5">Property condition<meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5"><div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div></div><div itemprop="reviewBody" class="rc-core-review-comment"><p>We loved it here.

It was amazing to sit out on the deck &amp; watch the water &amp; relax.</p></div></div><div class="rc-core-item-review"><h4 itemprop='name'>Weekend Getaway</h4><div class="reviewed-by"><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="March 2024">March 2024 <br /> <span itemprop="author">Donna J.</span>, Spring, TX US</div><br/><div class="rc-core-review-scores"> <div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-">Overall<div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div><div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-5">Services from rental manager<meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5"><div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div><div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-5">Cleanliness<meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5"><div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div><div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-5">Location<meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5"><div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div><div class="rc-core-review-score rc-core-review-score-5">Property condition<meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5"><div class="rc-item-rating-stars"><div class="star star-1 star-odd star-first"><span class="on">5</span></div><div class="star star-2 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-3 star-odd"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-4 star-even"><span class="on"></span></div><div class="star star-5 star-odd star-last"><span class="on"></span></div></div></div></div><div itemprop="reviewBody" class="rc-core-review-comment"><p>Our stay was relaxing and perfect!!
